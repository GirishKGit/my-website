This project involves building an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for the classic Iris flower classification problem. It leverages AWS SageMaker to automate the processes of model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.

**Key Features:**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the Iris dataset for modeling.
- **Model Training:** Utilized AWS SageMaker's built-in algorithms to train a classification model.
- **Model Deployment:** Deployed the trained model as a RESTful API endpoint using SageMaker.
- **Pipeline Automation:** Implemented an automated pipeline for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) using AWS services.
- **Monitoring:** Set up model monitoring to track performance metrics and data drift.
